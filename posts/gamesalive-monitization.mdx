hey everyone, i'm EleverBlue, the founder of gamesalive. i had a dream about gamesalive, and **gamesalive bypasser**, a premium subscription. y'all, i do not know. should i make gamesalive bypasser? like im scared people will come off this site. plus i want to find ways to introduce more games instead of using the traditional way. this is just my feelings and might happen. _idk if it will._
